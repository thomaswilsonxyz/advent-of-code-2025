# Wilson's Advent of Code 2025

- [2025-12-03] Day 1 SOLVED! Used Ruby for the first time in _at least_ twelve months.
- [2025-12-04] Day 2 SOLVED! Used Ruby again, with a few more idioms this time.
- [2025-12-06] Day 3 (pts. i & ii) SOLVED! Used Ruby.  The problems are _definitely_ getting a little harder now.  Testing my structures and algorithm knowledge 
- [2025-12-08] Day 4 (pts. i & ii) SOLVED! Actually solved these across two irl days.  Used Ruby, took a much more object-oriented approach.
